# Test Directory

This directory is reserved for unit tests and integration tests for the project's Python scripts and modules. Currently, no tests are implemented here.

## How to Add Tests

1.  Install `pytest` (included in `requirements.txt`).
2.  Create Python files (e.g., `test_scraper.py`, `test_database.py`) containing test functions (e.g., `def test_function_name():`).
3.  Run tests from the project root:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
